# Project Proposal

### Project title

Artwork Market

### What and why?

I (we) want to build up a collaborative and inclusive market for the amateur artist to share their creative works and merchandise with others who are interested. Similar systems are very focused on top-rated artists and their masterpieces, like ArtPrice, but many new artists do not have suitable platforms for them to advocate their concepts. Thus, they may feel disappointed and even cannot sustain themselves due to the lack of attention. Recently, many creative bazaars are hosted worldwide, mostly in urban areas, but these events are only short and periodic. A new well-functional platform is needed for better advertisements and exposure. 

### For whom?

The primary targets would be new self-served artists that do not affiliate with any organizations or studios. Thus, even though they are talented and have great ideas, they could not properly share and promote to others. Our platform will fulfill their need. They may also use our discussion panel to meet friends and potential collaborators to form their own social cycles. Also, our targets would also be people interested in modern and creative arts with a willingness of purchasing. 

### How?

Artwork Market would provide users to advertise their works and concepts in the following way: 
- Upload picture, price, and introduction to their artwork. 
- User space to store published artworks and stories (like vlogs, pictures, or thoughts). Freedom of organization and categorization of contents.  
- Chatbox to customers and other artists, including payments (which need authentication and documentation from our authority). 
- Discussion panel: just like the normal forum, the artists could establish a group chat to gather people with similar tastes. 
- Periodic events, like public online auctions or exhibitions. 
- If anyone wants to host an inperson meeting or market, they could open up threads and people could sign up.  

Other customers could signup for their account, directly glance through the products, and contact artists. 

We also need certain search engines or tagging for people to find their desired results. 

### Scope

We need two types of entrance, either artists or consumers, who have slightly different interfaces. Consumers have lower permission of publishing. We need 1-2 people to design the functionality of publishing and reviewing items. We need 1-2 people to design the discussion panel, like opening threads, adding content and comment, and opening/adding to a group chat. The consumer version of the interface may need 1 person. We probably need 1 more person to put all these pieces together and focus on their connections.
